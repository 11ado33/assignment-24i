# 24i Assignment

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

The application is a Web application that shows a simple example of carousel web page and the movie detail web page.

This site is not a UI master peace but a simple structure application that just is a micro viable product.

The "API" consist of one static file that is called by simple `axios` calls in a prepared structure of `redux` store,
that is not particularly used in this app right now.

## Available Scripts

The scripts are run by `craco` script to make the import aliases working in a simple way (there are many options to
achieve that though).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Prerequisites

To tun the app either in development mode or in produciton mode `npm install` should precede.
